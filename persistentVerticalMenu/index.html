                <p>This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The unexpected is our normal routine. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? I'll be sure to note that in my log. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? This is not about revenge. This is about justice. They were just sucked into space. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. How long can two people talk about nothing? Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. The unexpected is our normal routine.</p>
                <h3>Subheader 2</h3>
                <p>This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The unexpected is our normal routine. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this?</p>
                <h3>Subheader 3</h3>
                <p>Sorry, Data. and attack the Romulans. The unexpected is our normal routine. Damage report! Travel time to the nearest starbase? They were just sucked into space. Computer, lights up! Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book?</p>
                <p>Your shields were failing, sir. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. I'll alert the crew. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them.</p>
